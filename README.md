Full-stack application for tracking portfolio

Yet another application for tracking portfolio. The purpose of creating this is to stay up-to-date with 
latest trends in full-stack development and practice new concepts and ideas.

Currently the project is in active development stage, the following is created so far:

1. Portfolio-svc is a service which manages portfolio, holdings and transactions
2. Analytics-svc used for running analysis and graphs based on the portfolio
3. Frontend is, well, frontend

Plans for the future:

- Create helm charts for all services and finally glue everything together
- Introduce message broker for some of the async functionality
- Plug in some LLM for insights on the portfolio
